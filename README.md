1.	Code: https://github.com/gdombchik/sfnct/tree/sfnct_cfpb

2.	https://github.com/gdombchik/sfnct/tree/sfnct_cfpb/documentation:
a.	https://github.com/gdombchik/sfnct/blob/sfnct_cfpb/documentation/sfnct.pdf – A document that provides the director a review and audit of the original website.
b.	https://github.com/gdombchik/sfnct/blob/sfnct_cfpb/documentation/WordPress Admin Guide for SFNCT.pdf - A document that provides the director a guide on how to update SFNCT content using the WordPress admin tool.  

3.	The converted site is still in testing and will be made available to the public shortly.  The sfnct.org domain currently displays the prior website.  To transition more easily to the new site, I installed the WordPress site next to the old SFNCT site.  Both sites run on the server http://sfnct.org; however, the old site is using the domain home page.

(The current site is using the WordPress homepage.  I provided the link for the next menu page).
